            <p>This image was created by ASCII letters dictated by their brightness. The letters are decided through this String from decending density.<br><br>
            "@#%8&WM$BXGPDQHOCUAKdwmopxzncvnxrjftl|i!;:,."<br>
            <p>The Javascript code interates through the pixels of the image and calculates the pixel's brightness by averaging the rgb values. 
                Then the pixel is translated through a function so that the brightness can be tweaked; it balances it so that it is not too dark and not bright.<br><br>
                Then those values are combined together and sent to be created into a HTML paragraph as seen to the left. 
                If you want to, you can tweak the code and the function to make any ASCII art you want.
